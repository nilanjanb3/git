### What is Version Control System ?

Version control, also known as source control, is the practice of **tracking and managing** changes to software code. Version control systems are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time. As development environments have accelerated, version control systems help software teams work faster and smarter. They are especially useful for DevOps teams since they help them to reduce development time and increase successful deployments.

Version control software keeps track of every modification to the code in a special kind of database. If a mistake is made, developers can turn back the clock and compare earlier versions of the code to help fix the mistake while minimizing disruption to all team members.

### What is Git ?

By far, the most widely used modern version control system in the world today is Git. Git is a mature, actively maintained open source project originally developed in 2005 by Linus Torvalds, the famous creator of the Linux operating system kernel. A staggering number of software projects rely on Git for version control, including commercial projects as well as open source. Developers who have worked with Git are well represented in the pool of available software development talent and it works well on a wide range of operating systems and IDEs (Integrated Development Environments).

### What is GitHub ?

At a high level, GitHub is a website and cloud-based service that helps developers store and manage their code, as well as track and control changes to their code. 

### <u>Local Vs Remote Repository</u>

* Local repositories reside on the computers of team members. In contrast, remote repositories are hosted on a server that is accessible for all team members - most likely on the internet or on a local network.

* GitHub's collaborative approach to development depends on publishing commits from your local repository to GitHub for other people to view, fetch, and update.
